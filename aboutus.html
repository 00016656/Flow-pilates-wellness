            </div>
            <div class="history-desc">
               <p>My name is Shirin, I am the founder of the studio
Flow.
I started my first steps in the fitness industry in 2013 while in the UAE.
I was inspired by my husband, who at that time had already devoted a long period of his life to this particular area.
After the birth of my eldest daughter, I decided to get my first fitness education in order to consciously work on my body and it really helped me a lot.
My love for self-development and curiosity in 2016 led me to a new fitness specialization "pre"
and post natal".
Of course, thanks to the rapidly growing fitness industry in Dubai, it was easy to get access to various training programs, master classes and workshops.
5 years ago I discovered a completely new direction - Pilates. I fell in love with him! This is a unique direction in which I was able to reveal my potential. Feel all the muscles, improve not only your shape - but most importantly your health.
I have been fortunate to work with some of the best mentors who have taught me the importance of a holistic approach to everyone's health.
Let me welcome you to my serene space, the world of Flow...
